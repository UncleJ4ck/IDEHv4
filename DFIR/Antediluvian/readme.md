* **description** : Your company has received a suspicious Word document via email, which is believed to be a targeted attack aimed at compromising the organization. The email address appears to be from a trusted source, but upon closer inspection, something seems off. Your task is to identify and neutralize any potential security threats present in the document before it causes harm to the company's network. This challenge will test your ability to recognize and analyze malicious code and tactics used by attackers. Do not run this on your main machine always. Good luck and be vigilant!
