    Our company, THNB, has been under attack lately, and one of our machines has been infected with a malware called Voldemort. Your task is to reverse engineer it and use your skills in malware analysis to determine how the malware works and how it operates. You will need to use various malware analysis tools and techniques to dissect the malware and uncover its inner workings
Please be aware that running the malware on your main operating system is not recommended, and it is important to use an isolated lab for analysis. Additionally, any damage caused by the malware will not be the responsibility of the challenge provider .
